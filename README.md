## Purpose

I really wanted to do this project to get a better feel for MongoDB and to work with the React Maps GL. I have done work with Google Maps in the past, but with a paid account being essentially required I wanted to try a different option that is more cost effective. As for the database, I have pretty good experience in mySQL and Postgres but have not worked with MongoDB as much as I wanted to. So, it made sense to work on my experience with Mongo by simply doing a project
